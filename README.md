This repository demonstrates an uncommon error scenario in Python involving type errors during mathematical operations. The 'bug.py' file shows the erroneous code, while 'bugSolution.py' offers an improved version with more comprehensive error handling.  The bug arises when the function attempts division with a non-numeric type (e.g., a string or a list), leading to a TypeError. The improved version provides more informative error messages and handles various input types gracefully.
